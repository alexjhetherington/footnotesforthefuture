I love the nostalgia of looking back at old projects. It's a potluck gamble where the contributers are different versions of you from the past and the prizes range from "Oh god what the hell was I thinking" to "Huh, that ain't half bad."

You will find some of my [programming](https://github.com/alexjhetherington?tab=repositories) here. There will also be writing - development logs and fiction. You can already find some of my fiction on my [reddit account](https://www.reddit.com/user/fyve/submitted).

I'm building this website from scratch using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), learning as I go.

You can email me at: [footnotesforthefuture@gmail.com](mailto:footnotesforthefuture@gmail.com). I'd love to hear feedback for any of my projects, or work offers, or just general chit-chat. 

I also set up a [twitter](https://twitter.com/FootnotesFuture) account, because I feel obliged to have some form of social media for this site. I won't be using it proactively, but if you tweet me I will get a notification and will respond.

Enjoy. :)
